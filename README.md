# Object Detection using YOLOv8 and ONNX

This repository contains the code for an object detection system based on YOLOv8 and ONNX Runtime. The system is capable of detecting various object classes in static images and video streams with high accuracy and efficiency.

## Introduction

This project implements a real-time object detection system using the YOLOv8 model, leveraging the power of ONNX Runtime for fast inference. The system supports detection on both static images and video streams, and it can identify multiple object categories in real-time.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detects multiple object classes in images and videos.
- **High Performance**: Utilizes ONNX Runtime for efficient inference, especially when using GPU acceleration.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify detection thresholds, skip frames, and more to suit specific needs.


### Environment Setup

This project requires several dependencies, including OpenCV, ONNX Runtime, and Ultralytics' YOLOv8. Below are the detailed steps to set up the environment.
